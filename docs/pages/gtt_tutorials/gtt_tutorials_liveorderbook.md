## Introduction

The Live Orderbook will lie at the heart of almost any real-world trading
bot or algorithm.

In this tutorial, we illustrate the steps to hook a LiveOrderbook instance
up to a message feed and to start extracting information from it.

## Configuration

The [LiveOrderbook class](apiref/modules/_src_core_liveorderbook_.html)
configuration object has only one required field: `product`. Since an
orderbook represents a single trading pair, any message with a product ID
other than `product` will be filtered out.

The other config options are `logger`, to pass a global [Logger](apiref/modules/_src_utils_logger_.html) object
to the orderbook; and `strictMode`, a boolean, that determines the behavior when a skipped message is detected.

`LiveOrderbook` is a writable stream, so once you have a feed message stream, and applied whatever
 filters and transformers to it that you like, you can pipe it straight in and the orderbook will
 update itself automatically.

A standard template for creating and configuring a LiveOrderbook looks like this:

    const products = ['LTC-USD'];
    const logger = ConsoleLoggerFactory({ level: 'debug' });
    FeedFactory(logger, products).then((feed: GDAXFeed) => {
        // Configure the live book object
        const config: LiveBookConfig = {
            product: product,
            logger: logger
        };
        const book = new LiveOrderbook(config);
        feed.pipe(book);
        ...
    });

## Orderbook messages

`LiveOrderbook` emits an array of messages in response to certain events.

| Event tag | Emitted when | Data provided |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| LiveOrderbook.update | The orderbook changes due to a new order, a cancelled order, or a trade | A descendant of [OrderbookMessage](apiref/interfaces/_src_core_messages_.orderbookmessage.html) causing the change |
| LiveOrderbook.trade | a trade occurs | A [TradeMessage](apiref/interfaces/_src_core_messages_.trademessage.html) describing the trade |
| LiveOrderbook.ticker | Whenever the ticker is updated | A [TickerMessage](apiref/interfaces/_src_core_messages_.tickermessage.html) instance |
| LiveOrderbook.snapshot | When an orderbook snapshot is received, usually immediately after subscribing to the message feed. | The [SnapshotMessage](apiref/interfaces/_src_core_messages_.snapshotmessage.html) |
| LiveOrderbook.skippedMessage | if a sequencing error in the message feed is detected. | A [SkippedMessageEvent](apiref/interfaces/_src_core_liveorderbook_.skippedmessageevent.html)|
| error | An unrecoverable error occurs | The `Error` object |


## Orderbook methods and properties

All the orderbook methods and properties are near-realtime. You can query the last update time
with `book.timeSinceTickerUpdate` or `book.timeSinceOrderbookUpdate` which returns the time (is seconds)
since the last update to the orderbook.

Some of the handy properties available on `LiveOrderbook` are:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
|  sourceSequence | number | The last known sequence number from the underlying feed, if it exists. Some websocket feeds don't supply sequences, for example. |
| sequence | number | The sequence number as generated by the connected feed source. It may or may not correspond to `sourceSequence` |
| numAsks | number | The number of orders on the sell side of the book |
| numBids | number | The number of orders on the buy side of the book |
| asksTotal | BigJS | The total value of the sell side of the book (in base currency) |
| bidsTotal | BigJS | The total value of the buy side of the book (in base currency) |
| book | BookBuilder | Provides access to the underlying book builder. Note: Modifying the book will cause the `LiveOrderbook` to go out of sync. |
| ticker | Ticker | Returns the latest ticker information about the book |
| baseCurrency | string | The base currency for the trading pair (e.g. BTC in BTC-USD) |
| quoteCurrency | string | The quote currency for the trading pair (e.g. USD in BTC-USD) |

### ordersForValue

`ordersForValue` is probably the most useful method in `liveOrderbook`. It allows you to query
 the orderbook to determine which orders would be filled for a given trade.

This comes in useful for calculating things like average price, slippage and various other
 metrics for liquidity that are important for algorithmic trading.

The function takes a side ('buy' or 'sell') and a value and returns the orders that would be filled
by that trade. However, it also returns the cumulative size and cost/value of the trade at each level,
 from which all the liquidity metrics can be derived.

The 3rd and 4th arguments to `ordersForValue` modify the interpretation of the trade. `useQuote` instructs
the method to interpret `value` in quote currency rather than base currency.

And `startingPoint` allows you to specify an offset value (by default it is zero). This allows you to
calculate order tranches (the first 100 BTC, the second 100 BTC etc).

## Try it out

Given a running LiveOrderbook instance, the following snippet

    console.log(`Number of bids: ${book.numBids} asks: ${book.numAsks}`);
    console.log(`Total ${book.baseCurrency} liquidity: ${book.bidsTotal.toFixed(3)} asks: ${book.asksTotal.toFixed(3)}`);
    let orders: CumulativePriceLevel[] = book.ordersForValue('buy', 100, false);
    console.log(`Cost of buying 100 ${book.baseCurrency}: ${orders[orders.length - 1].cumValue.toFixed(2)} ${book.quoteCurrency}`);
    orders = book.ordersForValue('sell', 1000, true);
    console.log(`Need to sell ${orders[orders.length - 1].cumSize.toFixed(3)} ${book.baseCurrency} to get 1000 ${book.quoteCurrency}`);

would produce output similar to

    Number of bids:         1849    asks: 2297
    Total LTC liquidity:    4004381.314     asks: 172100.402
    Cost of buying 100 LTC: 4299.23 USD
    Need to sell 23.278 LTC to get 1000 USD

To respond to orderbook messages, simple add an event listener to the book. To respond to
ticker events you can do something like

    book.on('LiveOrderbook.ticker', (ticker: Ticker) => {
        console.log(ticker);
    });

And to track total trading volume since connecting, you would have

    let tradeVolume: number = 0;
    book.on('LiveOrderbook.trade', (trade: TradeMessage) => {
       tradeVolume += +(trade.size);
    });

A full working example can be found in the repository, in `src/tutorials/t002_liveOrderbook.ts`. It
 can be executed by running

    $ ts-node src/tutorials/t002_liveOrderbook.ts
