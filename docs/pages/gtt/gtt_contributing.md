The GTT is an open-source project. While it was conceived and is maintained by Coinbase, our vision is to have the community actively
contribute to the project.

To contribute to the GTT, [fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/coinbase/gdax-tt/), make your changes and [submit them as a PR](https://github.com/coinbase/gdax-tt/pulls). The community will review and
then hopefully merge your changes in, and it will form part of the next release of the GTT.

We want this to be a community project, so the GTT should evolve to become what you want it to be. So we will accept pull requests for
any and all of the following:
* Bug fixes
* New components and filters
* New exchange support
* Documentation
* Tutorials
* Working trading bot engines (that make use of the GTT, obviously)
* Algorithm components
* UI components (see the [gtt-ui](https://github.com/coinbase/gdax-tt/issues/52) project.

Please read and follow the contribution guidelines before you submit. This will smooth the flow for getting your code included in
the project.

## Contribution Guidelines

Pull requests must be written in [TypeScript](www.typescriptlang.org). If you're a Javascript programmer, don't fret, the learning curve is very flat.
TypeScript is a superset of Javascript, but because it is statically typed, whole classes of bugs are eliminated from your
code before it reaches us. Since the GTT can work with real money, we feel this is a good thing.

### Code Style

Make sure your code passes the linting tests before submitting your PR.

We use [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) for syntax checking. The specific rules we apply
are configured in the `tslint.json` file in the project folder.

To run the linter run

    yarn run lint

You can auto-fix many of the more typographic errors, assuming you've installed tslint globally by running

    tslint -p . --fix

You can also make your life much easier by adding TSlint integration into your editor. WebStorm / IntelliJ for example,
autofix many errors by running the Reformat-Code command.

### Unit tests

Our goal is to reach >80% for Beta and ultimately 100% test coverage.

For this reason we _highly encourage_ including unit tests in your PRs.

Our standard test runner is Mocha, and we use the standard `assert` module for assertions.

To run the full battery of unit tests run

    yarn test

### Documentation

Document your classes! The API reference documentation is automatically generated by [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/).
TypeDoc strips out the comments from files to generate reference documentation. The format is almost identical to JSDoc
with a few tweaks; primarily that you needn't include all the `param` and `return` fields because TypeDoc can infer this
directly from the code.

{% include warning.html content="If you run TypeDoc locally to view your generated documentation, *do not check those changes into your PR*!
For one, it adds too much noise to the PR and secondly, we will automatically update the API docs anyway." %}
