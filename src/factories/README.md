# Factories

This directory contains many convenience functions for CBPTT services that take care of 90% of the configuration for you, using sane defaults.

The exchange feed functions are named consistently for ease of use. However, if you need to use multiple exchnage factories in the same codebase, you need to prevent name collisions by importing the modules under aliases, to whit

    import { FeedFactory as CoinbaseProFeedFactory } from '../factories/coinbaseProFactories';
    import { FeedFactory as PoloFeedFactory } from '../factories/poloniexFactories';

Usually, `FeedFactory` is all you need, but `getSubscribedFeed` offers more flexibility by allowing you to pass in your own config object. (`FeedFactory` calls `getSubscribedFeed` under the hood).
